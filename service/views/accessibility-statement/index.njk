        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
            VoiceOver)
        </li>

    <p class="govuk-body">This website was last tested on 28th April 2023. The test was carried out by the Digital
        Accessibility Centre (DAC) Ltd.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">We used this approach to deciding on a sample of pages to test. The test combines technical
        auditing with disabled user feedback. The test does not list each specific area that requires change but highlights
        patterns of problems where they exist. The test covered the end-to-end digital service.</p>
